## Purpose

A shared space where users and AI agents collaborate to research players and teams and build high-quality daily fantasy lineups for DraftKings and FanDuel.

## What happens here

- Centralize player news, injuries, depth charts, matchups, betting lines, projections, and ownership signals.
- Let specialist agents (news monitor, projections combiner, slate analyzer, optimizer helper) work together—then summarize insights for humans.
- Produce slate-ready shortlists, stacks, and value plays aligned to DK/FD scoring, salaries, and roster rules.
- Export lineup pools/CSV, track revisions, and record rationale so you can audit decisions after lock.

## Core capabilities

- **Player Hub:** One page per player with recent usage, routes/snaps, red-zone work, volatility, comparable comps, and salary history.
- **Team & Matchup Cards:** Pace, pass/run rate, defensive tendencies, injuries, and game environment notes (totals, spreads).
- **Injury & News Monitor:** Always-on listeners that flag status changes, role shifts, and coach quotes; pushes actionable alerts.
- **Projection & Ownership Blend:** Combine multiple sources into a consensus with transparent weights; sensitivity testing included.
- **Slate Analyzer:** Identifies leverage, chalk pivots, correlation stacks, bring-backs, and late-swap paths.
- **Lineup Assist:** Human-in-the-loop lineup construction with exposure targets, min/max rules, and stack constraints; outputs DK/FD-formatted CSVs.
- **Knowledge & Audit Trail:** Every note, assumption, and lineup change is captured for post-slate review.

## Typical agent roles

- **News Scout:** Scrapes/streams updates, tags players/teams, and proposes swaps.
- **Projection Mixer:** Blends projections/ownership and recalculates when inputs move.
- **Slate Strategist:** Surfaces leverage spots, stacks, and game-theory notes.
- **Optimizer Liaison:** Applies rules/exposures and prepares final DK/FD exports.
- **Recap Writer:** Generates post-slate summaries and learnings for next week.

## Who it’s for

DFS players, analysts, and automated agents who want a single, structured workspace to move from raw info → ranked targets → exportable lineups with clear reasoning.

## Outputs

- Ranked player pools by position/site
- Suggested stacks and secondary correlations
- Exposure plans and late-swap contingencies
- DK/FD CSVs + concise slate brief
