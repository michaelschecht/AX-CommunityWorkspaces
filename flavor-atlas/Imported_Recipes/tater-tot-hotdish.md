## Headnote
Born in church basement kitchens and perfected at Friday night potlucks across the Upper Midwest, tater tot hotdish (never call it "casserole" in Minnesota) represents the pinnacle of practical comfort food. This one-dish wonder became a regional staple in the 1950s when Ore-Ida introduced frozen tater tots, and it's been feeding hockey teams, Lutheran ladies' circles, and extended families ever since. The beauty lies in its simplicity: ground beef, cream of mushroom soup, vegetables, and that golden crown of crispy tots.

## Ingredients
**Meat Layer:**
- 1 1/2 pounds ground beef (80/20 blend) — for best flavor and moisture
- 1 medium yellow onion (diced, about 1 cup)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

**Vegetable Layer:**
- 2 cups frozen mixed vegetables (corn, peas, carrots, green beans)
- 1 can (10.5 oz) cream of mushroom soup
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (divided)
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

**Topping:**
- 1 bag (32 oz) frozen tater tots
- 2 tablespoons butter (melted)
- Paprika for dusting

## Steps
1. **Preheat and prep** your oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish (standard size; for potluck use 2 disposable 9x13 aluminum pans). *(2 min)*

2. **Brown the meat** in a large skillet over medium-high heat, breaking up with a wooden spoon until no pink remains and meat is nicely browned *(8-10 min)*. Add diced onion and cook until softened *(3-4 min)*. Add garlic and cook until fragrant *(1 min)*. Drain excess fat, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pan.

3. **Season and combine** the meat mixture with salt, pepper, and onion powder. Spread evenly in the bottom of your prepared baking dish.

4. **Create the creamy layer** by mixing cream of mushroom soup, milk, frozen vegetables, ½ cup cheddar cheese, and thyme in a mixing bowl. Pour this mixture evenly over the meat layer. **Visual cue:** The mixture should just barely cover the meat—you should still see some meat peeking through.

5. **Sprinkle** the remaining ½ cup cheddar cheese over the vegetable layer.

6. **Arrange tater tots** in tight, overlapping rows covering the entire surface. Brush tops with melted butter and dust lightly with paprika for extra golden color. **Visual cue:** Tots should be snug but not stacked—one layer only.

7. **Bake uncovered** until tots are deep golden brown and crispy on top, the edges are bubbling vigorously, and the internal temperature reaches 165°F *(50-55 min)*. **Visual doneness cues:**
   - Tots should be golden-brown with crispy ridges (not pale)
   - Creamy mixture bubbles up around the edges
   - A butter knife inserted into the center comes out hot to the touch
   - Internal temp of 165°F ensures meat is fully cooked

8. **Rest** for 10 minutes before serving to allow the layers to set. This prevents a soupy first serving.

## Make-Ahead
Assemble completely through step 6 (before baking), cover tightly with foil, and refrigerate up to 24 hours or freeze up to 3 months. If baking from chilled, add 10-15 minutes to baking time. If frozen, thaw overnight in refrigerator before baking.

## Storage
Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat individual portions in microwave *(2-3 min on 50% power)* or reheat the whole dish covered with foil at 350°F for 20-25 minutes. For best results reheating, uncover for the last 5 minutes to re-crisp the tots under the broiler.

## Substitutions
- **Ground beef:** Use ground turkey, venison (popular in hunting season), or plant-based ground for vegetarian version
- **Cream of mushroom:** Cream of chicken, cream of celery, or homemade white sauce (3 tbsp butter, 3 tbsp flour, 1½ cups milk, seasonings)
- **Cheddar:** Colby, Monterey Jack, or American cheese work beautifully
- **Frozen mixed vegetables:** Use 2 cups of any single vegetable (green beans are traditional; corn is also popular)

## Variations
- **Wisconsin Style:** Add ½ lb crumbled cooked bacon to meat layer and use Wisconsin brick cheese
- **Upper Peninsula (Michigan) Pasty-Inspired:** Replace ground beef with cubed beef chuck and add diced rutabaga to vegetables
- **Minnesota Wild Rice:** Stir 1 cup cooked wild rice into the meat layer for heartier texture
- **Supper Club Classic:** Top with French-fried onions along with tots for extra crunch
- **Potluck Double-Batch:** For feeding 12-16, double all ingredients and use a full-size disposable steam table pan (approximately 12x20 inches). Baking time increases to 65-70 minutes.

## Allergen Notes
**Contains:** Dairy (cheese, milk in soup)

**Dairy-free adaptation:** Use dairy-free cream of mushroom soup (Pacific Foods brand), plant-based milk, and omit cheese or use dairy-free alternative. The dish will be less creamy but still delicious.

**Gluten concerns:** Most cream of mushroom soups and tater tots are gluten-free, but always verify labels. Some brands add wheat-based thickeners.
