## Headnote
These flaky, sky-high buttermilk biscuits are the cornerstone of Southern breakfast tables. The secret lies in cold butter, a light touch, and multiple layers created through lamination. Serve them hot from the oven with butter and honey, or split them for sausage gravy, fried chicken sandwiches, or strawberry shortcake. This recipe produces biscuits with a golden-brown crust and tender, layered interior that pull apart in soft sheets.

## Ingredients
- 3 cups all-purpose flour (360g) — plus extra for dusting
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter (170g, cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes) — keep refrigerated until use
- 1 1/4 cups cold buttermilk — plus 2 tablespoons for brushing
- 2 tablespoons melted butter — for brushing tops (optional)

## Steps
1. Position rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl until evenly combined.
3. Add cold butter cubes to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut butter into flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized butter pieces remaining. *Work quickly to keep butter cold—this creates flaky layers.*
4. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour in 1 1/4 cups cold buttermilk all at once. Using a fork, stir gently just until dough comes together in a shaggy mass. *Do not overmix—some dry spots are okay.*
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With floured hands, gently pat into a rough rectangle about 1-inch thick.
6. Fold dough in half like a book, then gently pat back to 1-inch thickness. Rotate 90 degrees and repeat this folding process 4 more times. *This lamination creates layers—handle dough gently to preserve butter pieces.*
7. After final fold, pat dough to 3/4-inch thickness. Using a 2.5-inch round cutter dipped in flour, cut straight down without twisting. *Twisting seals edges and prevents rise.* Place biscuits on prepared baking sheet with sides touching for soft sides, or 2 inches apart for crusty sides.
8. Gather scraps, gently pat together (do not re-fold), and cut additional biscuits. Brush tops with remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk.
9. Bake for 12-15 minutes until tops are golden brown and biscuits have risen to about 2 inches tall. *Internal temperature should reach 200-205°F.* Brush with melted butter immediately if desired.
10. Serve hot from the oven. *Biscuits are best enjoyed within 2 hours of baking.*

## Make-Ahead
Dry ingredients can be mixed and stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Keep butter cubes frozen separately. When ready to bake, proceed from step 3. Unbaked cut biscuits can be frozen on a baking sheet, then transferred to a freezer bag and stored for up to 3 months. Bake frozen biscuits at 425°F for 18-20 minutes without thawing.

## Storage
Room temperature: Best eaten fresh within 2 hours of baking. Cool completely and store in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Reheat in 350°F oven for 5-7 minutes.
Freezer: Wrap individually in plastic wrap, then place in freezer bag. Store up to 3 months. Reheat from frozen in 350°F oven for 10-12 minutes.

## Substitutions
- **Buttermilk:** Mix 1 1/4 cups whole milk with 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lemon juice; let stand 5 minutes before using
- **All-purpose flour:** Use White Lily brand self-rising flour (Southern preference) and omit baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Reduce to 2 3/4 cups flour total
- **Unsalted butter:** Salted butter works; reduce salt to 1 teaspoon
- **Butter:** For dairy-free, use cold vegetable shortening or vegan butter, though flavor will differ

## Variations
- **Cheddar and Chive:** Fold in 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 2 tablespoons fresh chopped chives with the buttermilk
- **Black Pepper and Herb:** Add 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper and 2 tablespoons mixed fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, sage) to dry ingredients
- **Sweet Biscuits:** Increase sugar to 1/4 cup for shortcake-style biscuits perfect with berries and whipped cream
- **Drop Biscuits:** Increase buttermilk to 1 3/4 cups, skip rolling and folding, and drop by 1/4-cup portions onto baking sheet. Reduce baking time to 10-12 minutes
