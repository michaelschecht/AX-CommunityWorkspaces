## Headnote
Texas brisket is the crown jewel of American BBQ—a 12-15 hour labor of love that transforms a tough cut into melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Born in the Central Texas meat markets of Lockhart and Elgin, this style celebrates simple seasoning, post oak smoke, and patience. The goal is a dark mahogany bark, a pronounced smoke ring, and meat so tender it jiggles on the cutting board. This recipe follows traditional Texas pit methods adapted for backyard smokers.

## Ingredients
- 1 whole packer brisket (12-16 pounds, untrimmed) — with flat and point intact
- 1/4 cup coarse kosher salt — 1.5-2% of brisket weight
- 1/4 cup coarse black pepper — fresh-cracked 16-mesh
- 2 tablespoons granulated garlic (optional) — for enhanced bark
- Post oak wood chunks (or oak, hickory blend) — 4-6 fist-sized pieces
- Beef broth or water — for spritzing, about 2 cups

## Steps
1. **Trim the brisket (1 hour before smoking):** Remove excess fat from the fat cap, leaving about 1/4 inch. Trim hard fat and silver skin from the bottom. Square up the point end. *A well-trimmed brisket ensures even cooking and better bark formation.*

2. **Season liberally:** Combine salt, pepper, and optional garlic in a bowl. Apply the rub generously to all sides, patting it into the meat. Let rest at room temperature for 45-60 minutes while smoker preheats. *The rub should look like a coarse coating—don't be shy.*

3. **Prepare the smoker:** Preheat smoker to 225-250°F using post oak or oak wood chunks. Aim for clean blue smoke, not thick white smoke. *Temperature stability is key—use a digital thermometer to monitor pit temperature.*

4. **Smoke fat side up:** Place brisket on smoker fat side up (or down if heat source is below—adjust to protect the meat). Insert probe thermometer into the thickest part of the flat. Smoke for 5-6 hours, maintaining 225-250°F. *Add wood chunks every hour for the first 3-4 hours.*

5. **Spritz during the stall:** When internal temp hits 150-165°F, spritz brisket with beef broth every 45-60 minutes. Continue smoking until internal temp reaches 165-170°F. *This phase can take 4-6 hours—the dreaded "stall" as moisture evaporates.*

6. **Wrap in butcher paper (Texas crutch):** Remove brisket and wrap tightly in uncoated pink butcher paper (or heavy-duty foil if paper unavailable). Return to smoker and increase temp to 250-275°F if needed. *Wrapping pushes through the stall and protects the bark.*

7. **Cook to probe-tender:** Continue cooking wrapped until internal temperature reaches 200-205°F and probe slides in like soft butter, about 2-4 more hours. *Temperature is a guide—probe tenderness is the true test.*

8. **Rest properly:** Remove from smoker and let rest wrapped in paper, placed in an empty cooler or warm oven (150°F) for 1-2 hours minimum. *Resting redistributes juices and allows collagen to fully break down.*

9. **Slice and serve:** Unwrap brisket and place on cutting board. Separate the point from the flat. Slice the flat against the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices. Cube or slice the point for burnt ends. *Sharp knife is essential—saw, don't press.*

## Make-Ahead
Season the brisket up to 24 hours in advance and refrigerate wrapped. Remove from fridge 1 hour before smoking to take the chill off. Wood chunks can be soaked for 30 minutes before use, though dry wood works equally well for long smokes.

## Storage
Refrigerator: Store sliced brisket in an airtight container or wrapped tightly with accumulated juices for up to 4 days. Reheat gently in a covered pan with a splash of beef broth at 300°F.
Freezer: Wrap sliced brisket portions in plastic wrap, then foil, for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in refrigerator. Reheat as above, or vacuum-seal before freezing for best results.

## Substitutions
- **Post oak wood:** Substitute with oak, hickory, or a 50/50 blend. Avoid mesquite for long smokes (too strong).
- **Whole packer brisket:** Can use just the flat (8-10 pounds), though point is fattier and more forgiving. Adjust cook time to 8-10 hours total.
- **Kosher salt:** Use coarse sea salt; avoid table salt (too fine). Calculate 1.5-2% of meat weight for proper seasoning.
- **Butcher paper:** Heavy-duty aluminum foil works in a pinch, though paper breathes better and preserves bark texture.

## Variations
- **Central Texas Style:** Salt and pepper only—no garlic. Let the smoke and beef shine.
- **East Texas Style:** Add 1 tablespoon paprika and 1 teaspoon cayenne to rub for sweeter, spicier bark. Mop with thin tomato-based sauce during final hour.
- **Burnt Ends:** After rest, cube the point into 1-inch pieces, toss with BBQ sauce, and return to smoker for 1 hour at 275°F until caramelized.
- **Coffee Rub:** Add 2 tablespoons finely ground coffee to rub for deeper, more complex bark.
